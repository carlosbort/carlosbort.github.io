I"C<p>This talk was part of the series <em>Leading in complex times</em> by <a href="https://www.ie.edu/university/">IE University</a>. The objective was to provide a theorical framework of how to approximate the prediction problem of Covid-19 disease, with data. The talk had the following structure:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Modelling process</li>
  <li>Disease and Data context</li>
  <li>Data Science problem</li>
  <li>Modelling - the total infected</li>
  <li>Estimations - infected and hospital resources</li>
  <li>Personal history and key learnings</li>
</ol>
