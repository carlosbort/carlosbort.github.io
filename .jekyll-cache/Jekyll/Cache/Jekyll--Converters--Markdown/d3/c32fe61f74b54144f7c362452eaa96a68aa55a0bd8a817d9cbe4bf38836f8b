In the <a href="https://2020.southsummit.co/EN/MySouthSummit">2020 edition</a> I have had the opportunity to talk about <em>Data connectivity at the core of disruptive business models</em>, as flashy as it sounds. Speaking with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-gil-lizasoain-271559/">Elena Gil</a>, Global Director at Telefonica IoT &amp; Big Data.</p>

<p>The main questions were:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What is being disruptive with data connectivity nowadays?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the challenges in data connectivity, that companies will need to face to stand out in the ecosystem?</p>
  </li>
</ul>
