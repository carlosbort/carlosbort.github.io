Hi there, my name is Carlos Bort and I like to do things. Some work, others don't, but the fun is along the journey. 

Since I was a child, I loved maths. During university I found statistics the most interesting subject by far, and ended up specializing as an Actuary and Statistician, nowadays Data Scientist. 

During the journey, I have found myself creating different companies [Sibilare](https://www.sibilare.com), [Xplore.ai](www.xplore.ai) & [Shalion](www.shalion.com) and data departments [Netquest](www.netquest.com). 


Things that I am proud of:

- Advise the government of Ecuador during COVID-19 crisis, recognized by [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecuador-city-beat-one-of-worlds-worst-outbreaks-of-covid-19-11593532974) & creating an [action guide](https://www.covid19actionguide.com) with some friends used in different countries of the world
- Create and collaborate with different non-profit initiatives to help the adoption of Data and Artificial Intelligence in Spain: [Barcelona Data Science Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/es/barcelona-data-science-machine-learning/), [R-user groups Barcelona](https://www.meetup.com/es/BarcelonaR/), & [AI Saturdays - Madrid](https://www.saturdays.ai/city-madrid.html)
- Won different Datathons (algorithmic competitions) with very close friends: [Accenture](https://fme.upc.edu/ca/noticies/accenture-digital-dtatathon-dos-estudiants-del-mesio-upc-ub-a-l2019equip-guanyador), [Huawei](https://retina.elpais.com/retina/2019/02/18/talento/1550486508_799428.html) & [Facebook](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA6jm4IuyGE

Friend of my friends, Carmela's boyfriend and Member of [Celera](https://www.acelerame.org).
