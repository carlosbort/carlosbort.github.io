[South Summit](https://southsummit.co/en/home/) is one of the most important Open Innovation and Start-ups fairs in Europe. In the [2020 edition](https://2020.southsummit.co/EN/MySouthSummit) I have had the opportunity to talk about *Data connectivity at the core of disruptive business models*, as flashy as it sounds. Speaking with [Elena Gil](https://www.linkedin.com/in/elena-gil-lizasoain-271559/), Global Director at Telefonica IoT & Big Data.

The main questions were:

- What is being disruptive with data connectivity nowadays?

- What are the challenges in data connectivity, that companies will need to face to stand out in the ecosystem?
