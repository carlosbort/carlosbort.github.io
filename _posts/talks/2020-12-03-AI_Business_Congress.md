[AI Business Congress](www.aibusinesscongress.es) is one of the most relevant events on **Artificial Intelligence for business in Spain and LATAM**. The initiative is part of [AI Network](https://www.ai-network.org), an association that I'm proud to be part of. The association aims to: *"Accelerate the adoption of Artificial Intelligence & Data technologies in Companies and in Society"* in Spain. 

In this first congress we to talked about the Spanish *AI Ecosystem*, with an incredible panel: 

- [Gonzalo Torres](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtorresporta/), Country Manager Spain at Talent Garden
- [David Rey](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidreyblanco/), Chief Data Officer at Idealista
- [Mariano Mu√±oz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marianomunozm/), Manager de Data y Analytics at Acciona
- [Eduardo Suela](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eduardo-suela-bb70039/) (Host), Chief data Officer and founder at Data Equity
- [Calos Bort](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carlosbort/), Head of Data Science at Smart Protection


The main questions were:

- How we see and understand the new AI Ecosystem, from each company's perspective

- The Spanish ecosystem, current state and future challenges
