[AI Saturdays](https://www.saturdays.ai/index.html) is an incredible project I am very proud to collaborate with. Our main goal is, *"empower diverse individuals to learn Artificial Intelligence in a collaborative and project-based way"*.

This talk was the last before the [AI Saturdays - Donostia](https://donostia.saturdays.ai) students presented their projects. A chapter lead by:

- [Be√±at Gald√≥s](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gtorresporta/), Founder at Galde
- [Joxemari Gallastegi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jgallastegi/), CEO at JOMA

As they summarized in the video: 

*üß† A decalogue of advice given by Carlos Bort based on his experiences in the field of Data Analysis. (...) Advice that tries to remove a certain aura of mysticism from this field, as well as trying to be realistic with the expectations of industrialization in this field, directly linked to the data culture or "data literacy" that businesses have today.*
