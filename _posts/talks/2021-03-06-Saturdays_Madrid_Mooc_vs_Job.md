Today we launched the 4th edition of [AI Saturdays Madrid](https://www.saturdays.ai/city-madrid.html), in coordination with [Aticco Coworking](https://aticco.com/coworking-madrid/). How far is the first edition!

- [AI Saturdays](https://www.saturdays.ai/index.html) is an incredible project I am very proud to collaborate with. Our main goal is, *"empower diverse individuals to learn Artificial Intelligence in a collaborative and project-based way"*.

This talk was the opening keynote where I reviewed the differences that you usually find, as Data Scientist, between the different Moocs and the real Job. 


A chapter lead by:

- [Lucía Trillo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucia-trillo-carreras/), Analyst at Cetelem
- [Mercedes Riveira](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mercedes-riveira-martin/), Researcher at European Commission
