[AI Saturdays](https://www.saturdays.ai/index.html) is an incredible project I am very proud to collaborate with. Our main goal is, *"empower diverse individuals to learn Artificial Intelligence in a collaborative and project-based way"*.

As co-organizer of the [Madrid chapter](https://www.saturdays.ai/city-madrid.html), I had the honor of giving the opening keynote for the 3rd edition. The talk was *10 tips I wish I had known before I started a data Journey*. 

Here are the 10 tips:


1. Context: data, computing power, ML
2. Think in a dimensional way
3. Make sense over dimensions -> Algorithm
4. Clever data over complex algorithms
5. There is NOT a ML problem waiting for you
6. Build end-to-end and iterate fast
7. Open Source, this is not a religion
8. Learn everyday & deal with the impostor syndrome
9. Be Humble
10. Future: Causal Inference, ML Engineer & mix profiles
