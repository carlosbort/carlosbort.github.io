This talk was part of the series *Leading in complex times* by [IE University](https://www.ie.edu/university/). The objective was to provide a theorical framework of how to approximate the prediction problem of Covid-19 disease, with data. The talk had the following structure:

1. Modelling process
2. Disease and Data context
3. Data Science problem
4. Modelling - the total infected
5. Estimations - infected and hospital resources
6. Personal history and key learnings

It was a pleasure working with [Clarissa Watson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/clarissawatson/), a top tier host!
